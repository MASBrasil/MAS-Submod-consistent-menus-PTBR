# All Scrollable Menus
### Oops! All Scrollables!

This submod replaces the standard Ren'Py menus with your choice of the following menus:
#### The `mas_gen_scrollable_menu`:
- The same screen used for large menus (Like the `Goodbye`, `I'm feeling`, `I want to tell you something` menus)
- Slides Monika over to the left
- Displays in the top right corner of the window

##### Sample:

#### The `talk_choice` menu:
- The same screen used for the main 'Talk' screen
- Slides Monika over to the left
- Displays on the right-middle of the window

#### The `unobstructed_choice` menu:
- Custom screen which is essentially a medium between the above two menus
- Monika doesn't need to slide over anymore
- Displays in the right middle of the window
