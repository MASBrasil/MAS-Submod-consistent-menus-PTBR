# All Scrollable Menus
### Oops! All Scrollables!

This submod replaces the standard Ren'Py menus with the MAS `mas_gen_scrollable_menu` (or the `talk_choice` menu if you wish).

As such, the following happens when a menu is open:
- Monika slides to the left
- The menu options show up in the top right, with smaller spacing
- When you click the option, Monika slides back to the middle
- Monika's face is no longer covered by menu options

### Please report any and all problems in the `issues` tab.
###### Thank you
